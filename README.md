# Identification of local beam stiffness from shearography measurements

## What is this?
This is a central repository for the source code of the paper
* Zastavnik, Pyl, ..., "Identification of local beam stiffness from shearography measurements", Journal of things and not-things, 2016

Together with the source of the paper itself, you can find here the sorce of the scripts used to generate all the figures, as well as the functions that you can use in your own projects or for further resarch.

## How can I use this?
We did our best to generate different views on the same material, depending on what you are most interested in:
* to read the traditional scientific journal paper, use the linked pdf or epub
* for a quick and interactive overview of the algorithm we present here, use the notebook (pyhton code inside)
* for interactive scripts that generate figures and tables in the paper, use this notebook
* to modify and improve the code or anyhting else in this repository, you can pull it
* to comment, discuss the work here with the authors or other users, go to comments section, associated subreddit or to the slack channel
